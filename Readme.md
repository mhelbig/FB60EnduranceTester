This is an Arduino based controller for an endurance tester for a feedback sensor.  The controller runs the test motor for 100,000 cycles and stops.  Measurements are then taken off the sensors under test and the test is restarted.  The controller also keeps track of the total number of test rotations.  Holding down the Start/Stop button at power-up clears the total counts.
